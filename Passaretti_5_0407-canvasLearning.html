  <h1>4/7/16</h1>
  <p>The canvas is an element in html that can make art via code. With javascript, we are
  we are able to create any picture using just code. There are lines for squares, circles,
  arcs, rectangles, gradients, and the list goes on. Each tag has VERY SPECIFIC parameters
  in order to get them to work. Also, with javascript, we can create art with loops. Since
  the aret is just made with numbers, we can use a loop to do "this" as long as "that" is
  "something". Then a pattern will appear, which can be easily changed just with numbers.</p>
