  <h1>4/12/16</h1>
  <p>For making an animation, all you need to do is set a code that well continually 
  change the value for something. Like the size or the location. For my independant animation, I will try to make a shape that bounces and spins around the screen. You can
  set location, rotation, and scale to move the shape to make it more diverse.</p>
