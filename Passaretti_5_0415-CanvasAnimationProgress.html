  <h1>4/18/16</h1>
  <p>My animation is almost finished. I have gotten 3 balls manifested that scale and 
  bounce off the screen in a random way so that there is no pattern. A function is a
  section of code that you execute at once. A function can be triggered in the code. It
  can also change it's output depending on input. There are different functions in my
  animation that set different speeds for each of the balls and making it so that when 
  they hit a side, they bounce off.</p>
